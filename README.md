## Introduction

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a basic image classification pipeline using a CNN. The model architecture and training setup are kept simple for illustration purposes. It classifies images into two categories: planes and cars.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Keras (>=2.0)
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation

- Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
```
- Install the required dependencies using pip.
```bash
pip install keras numpy pandas
```
## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can use the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in the 'train' and 'test' directories, respectively. It contains images of planes and cars organized in separate subdirectories.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture is as follows:

- Input layer (224x224x3)
- Conv2D layer with 32 filters, kernel size (2,2), and ReLU activation
- MaxPooling2D layer with pool size (2,2)
- Conv2D layer with 32 filters, kernel size (2,2), and ReLU activation
- MaxPooling2D layer with pool size (2,2)
- Conv2D layer with 64 filters, kernel size (2,2), and ReLU activation
- MaxPooling2D layer with pool size (2,2)
- Flatten layer
- Dense layer with 64 units and ReLU activation
- Dropout layer with 0.5 dropout rate
- Dense output layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation
  
## Training
- To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```
- You can modify the training parameters in the script as needed.

## Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using the following command:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
- This will provide accuracy and loss metrics on the test dataset.

## Prediction
To make predictions on new images, use the following command:
```bash
python predict.py path/to/your/image.jpg
```
- This will output the predicted class (plane or car) and the corresponding confidence score.

## Results
- After training the model, you can find the results and evaluation metrics in the 'results' directory.

## Contributing
- If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
